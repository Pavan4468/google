A Flutter-based mobile app to fight food waste by letting users swipe through discounted, near-expiry supermarket products. Built for the Google Solution Challenge 2025, targeting **SDG #12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.

## 🥦 About

**SwapSave** gamifies saving food! Users swipe right to add near-expiry supermarket deals to their cart (like Tinder), helping reduce waste while scoring sweet discounts. Supermarkets upload products using barcodes, and the app tracks how much food (and CO₂) users save.

It’s fun, sustainable, and scalable—built to make a real impact.

## 🧪 Progress Notes

Hey there! 👋  
This is my first working prototype of **SwapSave**, and honestly—it’s a bit rough around the edges. The swipe on the Home screen _kinda works_, but still needs some love. The bottom navbar’s in place, though not yet synced with the exact design from my video pitch. Life happens!

I’m building this with **Flutter** because it’s awesome , so things will keep improving over time. Stick around—cool updates are coming soon!
For quizzes or instant preview without setup, use Project IDX – just open the repo and run it in the cloud!
